# General Expectations

## 1. Attend weekly lab meetings.
It is understood that there are sometimes unavoidable conflicts, such as with scheduled courses taught or taken. If you know of such conflicts, it is your responsibility to touch base with another team member to see if any action items require your attention.

## 2. Engage in the laboratory communication channels.
The lab will use Discord to stay up to date on laboratory news. Group emails are highly discouraged because they leave no public record.

Sign up here: [Lab Discord](https://discord.gg/GF5WygYQ)

## 3. Complete human subjects training.

Lab members should take the CITI Human Subjects training and pass the quiz with a score of 80% or higher.
[CITI](https://about.citiprogram.org/)

Register using your CSU email and identify CSU as your institution. Enroll in either Group 1 (suggested) or Group 2 training. Once you complete the CITI exam, please post the following, verbatim, in the Discord channel #CITI:

*I have completed my CITI training and have send the certificate to Dr. Rojas*

## 4. Acknowledge understanding lab policies.
