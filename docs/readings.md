# Readings

The readings below are either required or suggested. The required readings are essential for those who conduct research using the technologies available in the lab. Human subjects readings are required for all personnel. Those under the technology specific headings are required for anyone handling that technology or data generated from that technology.

Note: All required readings are either linked to a public location, or kept on the lab Google Drive, [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gyxbN8syBasl_9W7_eA7hoW1ipj5Jbqu?usp=sharing). You may need to request permission to access the google drive. Please post requests in Discord channel #request-permissions.
