# Computing hardware and software

## Operating systems

The laboratory uses Windows and Linux OS, although many individual users prefer Mac OS for their personal computer/laptop. On Windows systems, the Department IT administrator controls access. Undergraduate RAs will be given a laboratory login that is used by all lab members. That login will be changed every semester. A laboratory graduate student can give you the login information. Dr. Rojas administers the lab's Linux computing platforms. You will need to contact him for login information. There is a request permissions channel in Discord to post requests. This is much preferred to email.

## Discord channel

The laboratory maintains a shared Discord channel for communications. Make sure you are signed up for the channel. Group emails are not encouraged for purposes of disseminating critical information in this laboratory. Directory/file permissions and login credential requests can also be made using the permission channel.

The sofware we use in the lab is generally free or low cost. Matlab is only free to users under the laboratory/department licensing, which only applies to computes located on campus. Office 365 is free to campus employees and students. If you want to use other software for laboratory business, and it is not mentioned in this lab manual, please contact Dr. Rojas for approval.
