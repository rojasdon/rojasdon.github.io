# Code of conduct

We expect that our laboratory spaces will be free from discrimination and/or harassment of any kind. All personnel, whether paid or volunteer, are expected to comply with Colorado State University guidelines concerning harassment/discrimination. The CSU policy on discrimination reads, in part:

*"Colorado State University is committed to providing an environment that is free from discrimination and harassment based on race, age, creed, color, religion, national origin or ancestry, sex, gender, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or pregnancy. Such an environment is necessary to a healthy learning, working, and living atmosphere because discrimination and harassment undermine human dignity and the positive connections among all people at our university."**
