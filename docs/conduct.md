# Code of conduct

We expect that our laboratory spaces will be free from discrimination and/or harassment of any kind. All personnel, whether paid or volunteer, are expected to comply with Colorado State University guidelines concerning harassment/discrimination. The CSU policy on discrimination reads, in part:

*"Colorado State University is committed to providing an environment that is free from discrimination and harassment based on race, age, creed, color, religion, national origin or ancestry, sex, gender, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or pregnancy. Such an environment is necessary to a healthy learning, working, and living atmosphere because discrimination and harassment undermine human dignity and the positive connections among all people at our university."*

Further information is contained in the following documentation, which lab members should follow and familiarize themselves with:

## Confidentiality and Data Security

All data in the laboratory is to be treated as strictly confidential, meaning it cannot be shared outside of laboratory personnel. To maintain confidentiality, please observe the following rules:

1. Do not share your login credentials with anyone outside of the laboratory.

2. Do not allow non-laboratory members into the lab spaces (e.g., unlock doors), even if they are your friends. If you wish to arrange tours, have them pre-approved by Dr. Rojas.

3. All paper records with participant information should be kept in locked file cabinets behind locked doors.

4. Do not discuss any identifiable participant information in a public space, even with other laboratory members, if non-lab members are present.

5. Do not remove identifiable records, digital or paper, from laboratory spaces or computers.

## Reporting

Violations of laboratory policies should be reported to Dr. Rojas immediately using a private Discord message or email. Unless your concern is about a Title IX violation, it will be treated confidentially. If your concern is about Dr. Rojas, please contact CSU Human Resources or the Dean's Office in the College of Natural Sciences.
