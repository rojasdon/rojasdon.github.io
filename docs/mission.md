# Mission

The purpose of this laboratory is to increase our knowledge of the human brain, in health and illness, in its full diversity of capabilities. The primary focus of the laboratory is to understand the foundations of neurodevelopmental processes in conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and childhood onset psychoses. We employ a variety of tools to achieve greater understanding, including neurobehavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging techniques, with an aim to help people live their best possible life.
