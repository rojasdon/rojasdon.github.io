# Publication Practices

In this laboratory, we engage in research to push the field forward. The size of the push is not important, but we commit to scientific endeavors that are meaningful in at least some small way. Therefore, we intend to disseminate our data to the scientific community and the general public. Dissemination of findings can take a variety of forms, including:

## Scientific conferences

## Peer-reviewed journal publication
