# Publication Practices

In this laboratory, we engage in research to push the field forward. The size of the push is not important, but we commit to scientific endeavors that are meaningful in at least some small way. Therefore, we intend to disseminate our data to the scientific community and the general public. Dissemination of findings can take a variety of forms, including:

## Scientific conferences

Abstracts can be submitted to local, national and international conferences. Travel costs can sometimes be paid, at least in part, for local or national conferences. Poster printing costs can be paid by the PI, but only on prior approval of submission of an abstract to a conference.

## Peer-reviewed journal publication

Undergraduate RAs and graduate students can participate in authorship of papers submitted for peer-reviewed publication. Please inquire with Dr. Rojas about opportunities and responsibilities associated with publication.

We believe that scientific publications should be available to the general public. Paywall publications are discouraged.
